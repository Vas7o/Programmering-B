      Around 2014, Marius shifted his focus from YouTube to music. He initially formed a nu-metal band called Myth City, where he was the lead vocalist. Myth City's music combined elements of rap, metal, and punk, which laid the groundwork for the aggressive sound Scarlxrd would later become known for. However, after releasing a few tracks and an EP, Myth City disbanded.
